calculate the sum of prime numbers:

Algorithm:

1: Start
2: Accept the minimum value from the user
3: Accept the maximum value from the user
4: let i= min value and count= to 0 and sum= to 0 
5: Repeat step 6 to 9 untill i is less than or equal to maximum value.
6: let j =1
7: Repeat the step 8 untill j value is less than or equal to i
8: If i divisible by j incremnt count by 1, increment j by 1
9: If count is 2 print i, sum= add sum and i and increment i by 1
10: print" primenumber is " sum
11. stop

pseuocode:

Begin
   Get min = 0
   Get max = 10
   Set i= 0
   Set count= 0
   set sum =0

For ( min = 0, min <= 10, min++)
  
  for ( max = 1, max <= 0, max++)
    if min value % max value == 0

      count = count + 1
    end if

   end for

     if count =2

      Begin 
       sum = sum + 1
      End 
      end if 

 Print sum
 End for 
End
