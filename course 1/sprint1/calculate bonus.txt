Algorithm

1. Start
2. Accept num of employees as count
3. Let i=1, total bonus =0, maximum bonus = 0
4. Repeat the process from step 5 to 10 if i is < or = to count
5. Accept the name and salary of the person as the input
6. bonus = (salary*12)*0.02
7. print name and bonus
8. check if the bonus is > or = to maximum bonus, then assign maximum bonus = bonus
9. increment i by 1
10. total bonus = total bonus + bonus
11. Print the total bonus
12. average bonus = total bonus/count
13. print average bonus
14. stop
